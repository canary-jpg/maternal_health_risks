# Assessing Pregnancy Risks
Because pregnancy is a transformative journey in women's lives, predicting and managing the risks associated with pregnancies are crucial to ensuring the lives of women and their unborn
children. This project aims to use the power of data science and machine learning to enhance the prenatal care and well-being of pregnant women. It seeks to develop a predictive model 
that can accurately assess the risks associated with pregnancy.
The data used for this project has been collected from different hospitals, community clinics, and maternal healthcare through IoT based risk monitoring systems.

Columns in this dataset:
* Age: Age in years when a woman is pregnant.
* SystolicBP: Upper value of Blood Pressure in mmHg, another significant attribute during pregnancy.
* DiastolicBP: Lower value of Blood Pressure in mmHg, another significant attribute during pregnancy.
* BS: Blood glucose levels is in terms of a molar concentration, mmol/L.
* HeartRate: A normal resting heart rate in beats per minute.
* Risk Level: Predicted Risk Intensity Level during pregnancy considering the previous attribute (high_risk, med_risk, low_risk).
